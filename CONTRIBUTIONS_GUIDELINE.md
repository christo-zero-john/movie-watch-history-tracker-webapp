## üßë‚Äçüíª Code Style

- **Use Prettier formatting** (2 spaces, single quotes, trailing commas where valid).
- **Use ES6+ syntax** (arrow functions, destructuring, etc.).
- **React Components:** Use functional components and hooks.
- **Naming:** Use `camelCase` for variables/functions, `PascalCase` for components.
- **Imports:** Group external imports first, then internal modules.
- **No unused variables** or imports.
- **Prefer `const`** over `let` unless reassignment is needed.
- **Add JSDoc comments** for complex functions or modules.
